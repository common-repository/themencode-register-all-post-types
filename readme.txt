This plugin will check database for all the post types and create the ones that are not registered using register_post_type() function.

== Description ==

I have recently imported a drupal site's content to a WordPress site but after the import, I found that many content are missing from wp-admin. I checked database and found that the content were imported as different post types. There were more than 30 post types. So, I started to think for an easy way to bring all the post types inside wp-admin.

That's the situation when I wrote this very simple plugin. This plugin will check for all the missing post types that has content in database but not registered in WordPress system & then create all the missing post types.

<h3>What after that ?</h3>
There are many things you can do after post types creation. You can keep all content in this post type or even you can convert to other post types if needed.
